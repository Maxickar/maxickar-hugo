Heya, my name is Maxwell Goisman, and I'm currently a sophomore at ASU majoring in computer science. I was born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, and went to elementary school at Sonoran Sky. For highschool, I went to BASIS Scottsdale, and for the last couple of years in highschool, I was participating in medical field programs like summer scrubs and pre med clubs, but after a while I started getting interested in programming, and eventually I graduated early to take online courses to then going to ASU.

I have roughly 2 years of experience in coding and discovering different coding languages that will guide me in my future, and I use my knowlege to make fun discord bots, where I combine recordings and commands into a discord bot(named Ben bot) to play those recordings or keep track of scoreboards. A hobby of mine is gaming, whether it's competitive, with friends, or just single player campaigns. And this hobby of mine is important, because it led me to making new friends, developing games like dark dawn, and more importantly, it led me to my major.
